## üìñ Project Overview  
This project explores the **factors influencing early readmission** in diabetic patients using **survival analysis**. Leveraging the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox Proportional Hazards models, we estimate survival probabilities and model the risk factors associated with being readmitted within 30 days.

## üîç Description  
Hospital readmissions are a significant burden on healthcare systems, especially among diabetic patients. Understanding the **time-to-readmission** and its determinants can improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, and enhance care quality. This project uses **statistical survival methods** to analyze readmission risk and propose data-driven interventions.

## ‚ùó Problem Statement  
Although patients are discharged after diabetic-related hospitalizations, **many are readmitted within 30 days** due to complications, poor follow-up, or treatment gaps. Identifying key factors that influence this early readmission risk is critical for healthcare planning and targeted care.
