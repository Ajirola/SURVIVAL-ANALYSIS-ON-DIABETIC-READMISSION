## üìñ Project Overview  

This project explores **time-to-event** data using **survival analysis** to investigate hospital readmission patterns among **diabetic patients**. Using **Kaplan-Meier estimators**, **log-rank tests**, and **the Cox Proportional Hazards Model**, we identify key factors contributing to early readmissions.

## üìå Description

**Survival analysis** is applied to diabetic US-hospital data for years **1999-2008** to study the duration until a patient is readmitted. The focus is on determining whether characteristics such as **insulin use**, **age**, and **medication count** affect **readmission time**.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

Hospital readmission within 30 days is a major concern in diabetic care, indicating potential issues in patient management. Understanding the survival patterns of diabetic patients and identifying predictors of early readmission can improve care planning.

## üéØ Objective

This project aim to:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Estimate survival times of diabetic patients
2Ô∏è‚É£ Test differences in survival between groups using log-rank tests
3Ô∏è‚É£ Assess the impact of variables using Cox regression 
4Ô∏è‚É£ Check proportional hazards assumptions

## üîç Key Areas Analyzed

1Ô∏è‚É£ Kaplan-Meier survival curves by:

  - Age group
    
  - Insulin usage
    
  - Medication group
    
2Ô∏è‚É£ Log-rank tests for group comparison
   
3Ô∏è‚É£ Cox Proportional Hazards Model (with and without stratification)  

4Ô∏è‚É£ Statistical assumption checking

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Source

The dataset was obtained from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.

Name: **Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999‚Äì2008**

Records: **101,766** diabetic hospital encounters

Link to the dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008

## üìÇ Dataset Description  

The dataset contains demographic information, lab results, and hospital outcomes for diabetic patients.

-**Total Records**: 101,766  

- **Initial Columns**: 50
 
For this project, the key variables used include:  

- **readmitted**: Whether the patient was readmitted within 30 days  

- **time_in_hospital**: Number of days spent in the hospital  

- **age**: Patient age group
  
- **insulin**: Insulin usage pattern
  
- **num_medications**: Number of medications prescribed

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Language**: Python

- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, Seaborn, lifeline

## üìí Methodology  

1Ô∏è‚É£ Import and clean dataset  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Define event and duration variables  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Encode categorical features and group medications  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Plot Kaplan-Meier curves and conduct log-rank tests  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Fit and validate Cox Proportional Hazards models  
6Ô∏è‚É£ Stratify by med_group to handle assumption violations
