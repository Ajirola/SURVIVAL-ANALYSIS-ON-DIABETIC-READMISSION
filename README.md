## üìñ Project Overview  

This project explores **time-to-event** data using **survival analysis** to investigate hospital readmission patterns among **diabetic patients**. Using **Kaplan-Meier estimators**, **log-rank tests**, and **the Cox Proportional Hazards Model**, we identify key factors contributing to early readmissions.

## üìå Description

**Survival analysis** is applied to diabetic US-hospital data for years **1999-2008** to study the duration until a patient is readmitted. The focus is on determining whether characteristics such as **insulin use**, **age**, and **medication count** affect **readmission time**.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

Hospital readmission within 30 days is a major concern in diabetic care, indicating potential issues in patient management. Understanding the survival patterns of diabetic patients and identifying predictors of early readmission can improve care planning.

## üéØ Objective

This project aim to:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Estimate survival times of diabetic patients

2Ô∏è‚É£ Test differences in survival between groups using log-rank tests

3Ô∏è‚É£ Assess the impact of variables using Cox regression 

4Ô∏è‚É£ Check proportional hazards assumptions

## üîç Key Areas Analyzed

1Ô∏è‚É£ Kaplan-Meier survival curves by:

  - Age group
    
  - Insulin usage
    
  - Medication group
    
2Ô∏è‚É£ Log-rank tests for group comparison
   
3Ô∏è‚É£ Cox Proportional Hazards Model (with and without stratification)  

4Ô∏è‚É£ Statistical assumption checking

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Source

The dataset was obtained from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**.

Name: **Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999‚Äì2008**

Records: **101,766** diabetic hospital encounters

Link to the dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008

## üìÇ Dataset Description  

The dataset contains demographic information, lab results, and hospital outcomes for diabetic patients.

- **Total Records**: 101,766  

- **Initial Columns**: 50
 
For this project, the key variables used include:  

- **readmitted**: Whether the patient was readmitted within 30 days  

- **time_in_hospital**: Number of days spent in the hospital  

- **age**: Patient age group
  
- **insulin**: Insulin usage pattern
  
- **num_medications**: Number of medications prescribed

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Language**: Python

- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, Seaborn, lifeline

## üìí Methodology  

1Ô∏è‚É£ Import and clean dataset  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Define event and duration variables  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Encode categorical features and group medications  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Plot Kaplan-Meier curves and conduct log-rank tests  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Fit and validate Cox Proportional Hazards models  
6Ô∏è‚É£ Stratify by med_group to handle assumption violations

## üßπ Data Cleaning  

To ensure data quality and suitability for survival analysis, several preprocessing steps were performed:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Variable Selection  
Only variables relevant to the survival analysis were retained from the original dataset containing 50 columns. The selected variables were:

- age
- time_in_hospital
- num_lab_procedures
- num_medications 
- number_diagnoses
- insulin
- readmitted 

‚úÖ This step reduced the dataset to a focused subset of **7 key features** for time-to-event modeling.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Check for Missing Values  
A missing value assessment was conducted across the selected columns.

‚úÖ **No missing values** were detected in the final filtered subset used for survival analysis.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Remove Duplicates  
Duplicate entries can bias model estimates and inflate sample size.

- A check revealed **3,877 duplicate rows**.
  
- All duplicate rows were removed to ensure each patient encounter was uniquely represented.

‚úÖ Final data had **no remaining duplicates**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Filter Invalid or Unknown Categories  
Certain values were invalid or non-informative for modeling:

- Rows with **invalid or unknown ag values** (e.g., **?**) were removed.  

- The **insulin variable** initially included non-standard values like **No**
 
‚úÖ The dataset was filtered to keep only valid insulin usage types:  
 **Up**, **Down**, **Steady**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Define Event and Duration for Survival Modeling  

Two critical columns were created for survival analysis:

- **event**: Indicates whether the patient was readmitted within 30 days  
  - **event = 1** if **readmitted == '<30'**
  - **event = 0** if **readmitted == No or >30**

- **duration**: Time spent in hospital, used as the survival time  
  - **duration = time_in_hospital**

‚úÖ These columns allowed modeling of time-to-event outcomes.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Categorical Variable Transformation  

- The **age variable** was stored in ranges like **[60-70)**, so it was converted into an **ordered categorical variable** to preserve group structure during modeling and plotting.
  
- The custom order was defined as:  
  [0-10), [10-20), [20-30), [30-40), [40-50), [50-60), [60-70), [70-80), [80-90), [90-100)
  
### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Medication Grouping  

To analyze the effect of medication usage more meaningfully, the continuous variable **num_medications** was converted into **categorical bins** to form a new column **med_group**:

- **Low**: 0‚Äì10 medications
- **Moderate**: 11‚Äì20
- **High**: 21‚Äì40  
- **Very High**: 41 and above  

‚úÖ This grouping allowed for better interpretation in visualizations and Cox modeling.

### ‚úÖ Final Dataset Summary  

| Step                         | Result            |
|------------------------------|-------------------|
| Initial Rows                 | 101,766           |
| After removing duplicates    | 97,889            |
| After filtering and cleaning | 54,383            |
| Final Columns                | 10                |

The dataset was now clean, well-structured, and ready for **exploratory data analysis** and **survival modeling**.
